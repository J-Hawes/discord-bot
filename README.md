# Discord Bot

> A NodeJS, DiscordJS, and Twitter API Project

This project is a learning experience for me, to familiarise myself more with NodeJS, 
while learning the Twitter API and Discord API.
This also has the added benefit of being a purpose built bot to combine the functions of 
and eliminate the 5 'other' bots I am using in my server for the same tasks.
